# Tom's School Of Life Plugin

Dedicated WordPress plugin for Tom's School Of Life.

This plugin is intentionally site-specific. It should contain behavior that belongs to this website and should not be added to the shared Access Platform SSO plugin.

## Optional Access SSO integration

Access Platform SSO is an optional upstream WordPress login source. The TSOL plugin and Library authentication bridge continue to load when it is absent. MemberPress, not Access SSO, is the protected-content authorization authority.

Supported development/deployed plugin basenames:

- `wp-access-sso/access-platform-sso.php`
- `wp-access-sso-1.1.3/access-platform-sso.php`
- `access-platform-sso/access-platform-sso.php`

## Feature Pattern

Each client-specific feature should live in its own folder under `includes/features/{feature-name}/` and implement `TSOL_Site_Feature`.

Feature assets should live in `assets/features/{feature-name}/`. Register the feature in `TomsSchoolOfLifePlugin::register_features()`.

## Accountability Modal

The accountability modal is automatic, not shortcode-based. It renders only on selected singular content locations for logged-in users who are not currently in an accountability group and have not already submitted the intake form. The modal opens after the visitor scrolls down the page.

The intake form stores responses in user meta and lists only published MEC accountability events mapped to Groups children of the accountability parent group. Events marked with `group_full` truthy values are treated as waitlist-only and excluded from the modal choices.

Admins can manually open the modal from the WordPress admin bar while viewing a selected display location.

In-progress answers can be saved locally in the user's browser and are cleared after a successful submission. If a user closes the modal before submitting, a branded square-aspect circular launcher appears in the configured screen corner so they can reopen and finish the form. The launcher uses the uploaded site-icon mark as a centered white mask and can show a short progress bubble once the user has completed more than one step.

The display locations, scroll threshold, local draft behavior, resume launcher behavior, admin preview button, member/submission hiding rules, modal copy, and question flow can be managed in WordPress under `TSOL > Accountability Modal`.

Gemini configuration is isolated under `TSOL > Accountability Modal > AI Matching`. That tab owns the Accountability-specific API key status, model, enable switch, strong-fit threshold, fallback explanation, and data-sharing notice. The generic TSOL settings page deliberately does not present Gemini as a site-wide integration, and the TSOL Library does not use this credential.

The `Display Rules` tab includes a searchable content picker with selected-location review rows and filters for content type, publish status, and selected/unselected state.

The `Content` tab includes an ACF-style accordion question repeater. Admins can add, remove, reorder, enable/disable, and require questions. Question keys are generated automatically from the question title. Supported field types are text field, text area, number, number slider, select dropdown, checkbox select, radio select, and the dedicated joinable accountability calls selector.

The `Submissions` admin tab reads the saved user meta in review cards with user actions, intake answers, selected call availability, and recommended group fits. It supports search, status/call/date filters, sorting, pagination, CSV export for either all submissions or the current filtered/sorted result set, and nonce-protected deletion of a user's saved intake submission. Availability is always enforced before optional Gemini ranking; unavailable or weak AI results fall back to open-call choices. A separately validated join action can enroll a member when the accountability enrollment engine is available.

Accessibility support includes dialog labeling, described-by copy, Escape close, focus trapping, focus return, keyboard-accessible launcher, progressbar semantics, live status messages, and reduced-motion handling for launcher animation. It should still receive real screen-reader/browser QA before being treated as formally audited for WCAG conformance.

The target content IDs can still be changed with the `tsol_site_accountability_modal_page` filter.

## Cookie Consent

The cookie consent feature renders an on-brand TSOL banner and preference center for public visitors. It stores consent in a first-party cookie and expiring localStorage fallback, supports a floating cookie settings button, respects Global Privacy Control for marketing choices, removes known first-party cookies after rejection, and can be opened by admins from the frontend admin bar.

The feature prints Google Consent Mode v2 defaults early in the page head and updates Consent Mode after the visitor chooses. Analytics and marketing scripts added under `TSOL > Cookie Consent > Scripts` are loaded only after the relevant category is accepted.

Important: this feature cannot stop scripts that are hard-coded by another plugin, theme, HFCM snippet, or GTM tag before consent. Non-essential tracking should be moved into the cookie consent script buckets or configured inside GTM to obey Consent Mode. Third-party and HttpOnly cookies cannot be removed by frontend JavaScript, so their originating tracker must be prevented from loading when consent is denied.

The official Tapfiliate plugin's `tapfiliate-js` handle is captured automatically and emitted as inert Marketing-category scripts. This preserves its WooCommerce conversion data while allowing the consent frontend to control when the vendor code executes. Additional registered WordPress script handles can opt into the same mechanism with the `tsol_site_cookie_consent_managed_script_handles` filter.

The existing WPCode Tapfiliate handlers (snippet IDs `102804` and `102816`) are also converted to inert Marketing-category script tags. The IDs can be changed with the `tsol_site_cookie_consent_wpcode_marketing_snippet_ids` filter.

## MemberPress REST Content Guard

The site companion enforces MemberPress authorization on core WordPress REST post and page reads even when MemberPress's optional REST-protection toggle is disabled. Anonymous and unauthorized users cannot retrieve protected bodies through direct item endpoints or collection queries. Authorized members and administrators continue to use MemberPress as the sole access authority; the plugin does not maintain a second membership list.

Protected direct responses use private, no-store, no-sniff, and no-index headers. The known high-sensitivity fallback post IDs can be changed with `tsol_site_rest_guard_sensitive_post_ids`; source control must never contain the underlying password, bucket name, or object URLs.

Legacy HFCM snippet `4` (Google), Vimeo snippets `14`, `21`, `26`, `28`, and `37`, RocketChat snippet `24`, and retired Kissmetrics snippet `57` are intercepted at the HFCM render hook. Their script tags are made inert under Marketing or Analytics consent while preserving each snippet's display rules; the ID/category map can be changed with `tsol_site_cookie_consent_hfcm_snippet_categories`.

Server-rendered Vimeo and YouTube iframes are held behind Marketing consent, and Elementor video-lightbox links open the cookie preference dialog when Marketing is not yet allowed. The host/category map can be changed with `tsol_site_cookie_consent_embed_hosts`.

## Library Authentication

Configure the bridge under `TSOL > Library Authentication`. It uses an OAuth-style authorization-code flow with mandatory S256 PKCE, exact callback matching, one-use 60-second hashed codes, five-minute bearer tokens, server-authenticated content-access checks, rate limits, no-store responses, explicit `DONOTCACHEPAGE` and WP Rocket exclusions, and signed, audience-bound, one-time cross-application logout.

The server-authenticated `/wp-json/tsol-library/v1/header-navigation` endpoint
reads the Elementor header menu as an anonymous visitor and returns its safe
public links for the Library Explore menu. Account, login, logout, and
Library-home entries are excluded, so the same Explore menu is available to
signed-in and signed-out visitors.

The plugin also registers a **TSOL Library Footer** menu location under WordPress navigation settings. Its server-authenticated `/wp-json/tsol-library/v1/footer-navigation` endpoint returns up to 12 safe HTTP(S) links in menu order. If no menu is assigned, it returns an empty list and the Library omits the WordPress-managed footer section.

Every authenticated WordPress account can enter and browse the Library. Access to each protected course or lesson is decided from that content's existing MemberPress rules, including drip and expiry behavior; unprotected published content is available to signed-in users. WordPress users with `manage_options` retain full administrator access. The plugin does not maintain a second membership or staff allowlist.

Administrators create named reusable authorization packages under **TSOL
Library → Access Groups** and define the broad Library areas, Collections,
Courses, or Series each package unlocks. A **Library Access Groups** panel on
each MemberPress membership assigns one or more of those packages to the
product. The saved mapping is only a draft: MemberPress remains the runtime
authority. Publishing first
creates inactive native MemberPress rules and compares every current WordPress
user against every current Library authorization target. The operation is
blocked if any current user would lose access, requires the exact confirmation
phrase `publish-access-groups`, detects source-rule changes, and retains a
one-step rollback to the previous native rules. Memberships, subscriptions,
transactions, legacy MemberPress Courses, and non-Library MemberPress rules are
not rewritten by the grouping layer. Every published rule affecting TSOL
Library content must be owned by Access Groups before a new policy can be
checked or published. A guarded reconciliation can absorb separately shipped
TSOL-owned Library rules without changing live access; arbitrary MemberPress
rules are never changed automatically.

## Test-to-production Library migration

Administrators can move the WordPress-owned Library setup under **TSOL Library
→ Migration**. Export on the test site, upload the JSON file on production,
review the read-only conflict report, and type the displayed confirmation
phrase to import. The self-contained ZIP uploads in 512 KB browser chunks, so it
is not constrained by the server's normal single-request upload limit. The
importer verifies every declared file's size and SHA-256 checksum, maps Library records by immutable UUID,
MemberPress memberships by stable slug, and existing uploads by their relative
WordPress upload path. Older independently imported records may be adopted in
place only when post type and slug match and either the title or legacy
authorization source also agrees. Referenced uploads are registered in the
production Media Library; a production file at the same path with different
bytes is a blocking conflict rather than a silent overwrite.

The package contains courses, series, content, Speaker profiles, Library terms,
homepage curation, attachment references, Access Groups, and membership-to-group
assignments, plus the referenced WordPress upload binaries. It never contains the standalone Library application database,
application accounts, sessions, progress, notes, bookmarks, WordPress users,
MemberPress subscriptions or transactions, credentials, logs, generated
MemberPress rules, or temporary operational state.

Import creates a rollback snapshot and leaves Access Groups as a draft. The
current production MemberPress rules remain live until an administrator stages
the imported groups, reviews the full current-user/content decision matrix, and
explicitly publishes them. An access stage must be rolled back before the
environment import itself can be rolled back.

The MemberPress Account page includes a **Security** tab for signing the member
out of the standalone Library on every device. The authenticated action uses a
POST request, WordPress nonce, and explicit confirmation before placing the
existing `user.sessions_forced_logout` event in the durable signed revocation
outbox. It revokes Library sessions only; the current WordPress, MemberPress,
or upstream Access login may remain active. A narrow MemberPress view filter
keeps the Security link available when an older child-theme account override
omits the standard custom-navigation hook.

The URL and client ID can be managed in the plugin UI. The write-only
client-secret option never renders the stored value and is available when host
configuration access is unavailable, including in production. A host-managed
`TSOL_LIBRARY_CLIENT_SECRET` constant remains preferred and disables the
editable field when present. `TSOL_LIBRARY_APP_URL` and
`TSOL_LIBRARY_CLIENT_ID` remain optional host overrides. Use separate clients
and secrets for development, staging, and production.

Bridge request limits use an atomic WordPress database table shared across PHP
instances. Valid server traffic is scoped by endpoint/client ID and WordPress
user where applicable instead of only by a common egress address. Invalid
client traffic uses the directly connected address; configure the
`tsol_library_auth_client_ip` filter only when a trusted proxy overwrites and
validates its forwarding header.

Configure `TSOL_LIBRARY_AUTH_REVOCATION_SECRET` only as a host-managed
WordPress constant and use the same dedicated value in the Library secret
manager. It must be at least 32 bytes and must not equal the client or catalogue
webhook secret. Password changes or resets, user deletion, role changes, and relevant
identity changes enter a durable signed outbox that revokes all matching
Library sessions. Suspension and security tooling can request an allowlisted
event after committing its canonical state:

```php
do_action('tsol_library_auth_revocation_requested', $user_id, 'user.suspended');
```

Delivery retries with bounded backoff, maintains a one-minute recovery
watchdog, and treats the Library's `409` replay response as acknowledgement of
a previously applied one-time `jti`.

Run the WordPress contract checks from the plugin directory with:

```bash
wp eval-file tests/library-auth-contract.php --skip-themes
wp eval-file tests/library-auth-revocation-contract.php --skip-themes
wp eval-file tests/library-account-security-contract.php --skip-themes
```

## Library Content

The standalone Library has a dedicated top-level `TSOL Library` admin menu.
Its private `tsol_library_course` and `tsol_library_item` types own the new
editorial structure. Native MemberPress Courses and legacy Pages remain
untouched; MemberPress Rules remains the sole live access authority.

The local clone importer currently produces six draft courses and 144 draft
content records while delegating all 150 access mappings to their unchanged
legacy sources. Watch routes use immutable content UUIDs, kept separate from
authorization pointers. The native Course body is the public **About this
course** source; protected downloads and links belong in lesson Resources.
Every Library/Speaker body sent to the application passes through the shared
strict semantic HTML sanitizer. See `includes/features/library-content/README.md` and
`../plans/tsol-library-content-model.md` for the model and verification record.

Library Items also provide a private Transcript meta box for replacing a UTF-8
WebVTT file. WordPress retains that source in private post metadata, includes it
in WordPress-only Library migration packages, and delivers it to the School app
through a signed, retryable callback after verifying the exact content UUID and
video-provider identity.
